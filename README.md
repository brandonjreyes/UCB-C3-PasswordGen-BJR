# UCB-C3-PasswordGen-BJR

The site is designed to randomly generate a password based on some entered criteria.

Once the user presses the button, they will be prompted for the length of the password, 
and wether they would like it to contain lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. 

If the desired length is too long / too short, or no characters have been chosen, the user will 
recieve an alert that their entry was invalid, and to try again.
